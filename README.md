# Blueberry Network Rewiring
Breed new blueberry cultivars that are resistant to the blueberry stem gall wasp. Examine standing genetic variation in the population of blueberry cultivars to identify resistant blueberry cultivars and the genomic loci responsible.


[Previously](https://github.com/EdgerLab/Blueberry_RNA_Seq_Expression_Analysis), differentially expressed genes were quantified from RNA-Seq data gathered from Liberty and Draper cultivars. Work now continues on comparing metabolic pathway flux and structure following gene expression perturbation following gall wasp infection.
